## ABOUT 
### Hey! üëã
I'm Rofly, a computer engineering student, always looking for new opportunities to improve my skills. 

My interest in programming began a few years ago and since then I've dedicated my time to studying it. I'm constantly looking to broaden my knowledge and keep up to date with the best practices and trends in this area. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and explore new areas of programming. I am an independent, organized and collaborative person who enjoys tackling complex challenges to broaden my knowledge base and improve my problem-solving skills. At the moment I'm currently studying at University Institute of Lisbon and 42 lisboa And if you're interested in seeing related projects, take a look below ‚¨áÔ∏è
